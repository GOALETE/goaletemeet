Note: Full testing requires database configuration and is recommended in a development environment.

## Manual Testing Checklist (for Development Environment)

1. Complete a test registration with Monthly Family plan
2. Verify that both users are created in the database
3. Check that both subscriptions are created with correct price
4. Verify welcome emails are sent to both users
5. Check admin notification contains details of both users
6. Run CRON job to test sending meeting invites to both users
7. Verify both users appear correctly in the admin dashboard

## Conclusion

The Monthly Family plan implementation is complete and properly documented. The code structure supports:

- Two users registering under a single payment
- Individual user accounts for both people created consistently in the frontend
- Email validation to prevent duplicate emails between users
- Integrated Razorpay payment flow
- Separate subscription records for tracking
- Dedicated email notifications for both users
