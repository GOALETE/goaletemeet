3. **Communication Tools**: No direct user communication
4. **Automated Workflows**: Manual processes that could be automated

### Technical Debt

4. **Testing Coverage**: Limited automated testing

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures
- Environment-based authentication
- Session-based access control
